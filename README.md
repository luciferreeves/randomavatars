The only NPM library which uses the [Robohash](https://github.com/e1ven/Robohash) algorithm by [Colin Davis](https://github.com/e1ven) â€” so go to his GitHub page and show some love.

## What this actually does?

It basically takes a string and returns an avatar for it. In the backgrounf it works the same as Robohash, i.e., it copy/pastes various pictures together, using bits from the SHA hash. Consider this a JavaScript translation of the actual Python based Robohash library.

## Usage Documentation

Coming soon.

The avatar sets are the same sets used in the Robohash library, but I thought they deserve some credit here too.
